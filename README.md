## Overview ‚úçÔ∏è
This is a simple flask app that is check your loan status in State Bank Of India üè¶ . 
This model is trained over real State Bank Of India Data.


## Motivation üí™
Motivation is so interesting behind the creation of this project, Actually In my village, one of my Best friends father say that last five days he goes SBI Bank only to know Bank give me a loan or not because there are something issues with the previous loan (he already clear the loan). That time suddenly in my mind comes to the idea of why we do not create such type of model that takes some parameter and based upon this parameter the model predicts the loan status. I know banks give loans or not it depends upon other factors but it gives at least a high-level idea.
## Introduction
***.*** Loan-Prediction. 

***.*** Understanding the problem statement is the first and foremost step. This
would help you give an intuition of what you will face ahead of time. Let
us see the problem statement.

***.*** Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have
presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first
apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility
for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real
time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application
form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of
Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To
automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the
customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can
specifically target these customers.

## The Classification problem
***.*** It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan
would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to
predict discrete values based on a given set of independent
variable(s). Classification can be of two types: \

***.*** Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of
the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or
female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc. Multiclass
Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more
classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or
romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc. \

***.*** Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail
bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a
lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.
## FEATURES PRESENT IN LOAN PREDICTION
***.*** Loan_ID ‚Äì The ID number generated by the bank which is giving loan. \
***.*** Gender ‚Äì Whether the person taking loan is male or female. \
***.*** Married ‚Äì Whether the person is married or unmarried. \
***.*** Dependents ‚Äì Family members who stay with the person. \

***.*** Self_Employed ‚Äì Whether the person is self-employed or not. \
***.*** ApplicantIncome ‚Äì The basic salary or income of the applicant per month. \
***.*** CoapplicantIncome ‚Äì The basic income or family members. \
***.*** LoanAmount ‚Äì The amount of loan for which loan is applied. \
***.*** Loan_Amount_Term ‚Äì How much time does the loan applicant take to pay the loan. \
***.*** Credit_History ‚Äì Whether the loan applicant has taken loan previously from same bank.\
***.*** Property_Area ‚Äì This is about the area where the person stays ( Rural/Urban).\
***.*** Property_Area ‚Äì This is about the area where the person stays ( Rural/Urban).\
***.*** LOAN_STATUS ‚Äì Based on the mentioned features, the machine learning
algorithm decides whether the person should be give loan or not.
